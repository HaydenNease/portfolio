# CSS Portfolio Challenge
Application is live at https://haydennease.github.io/portfolio/
## Description
The purpose of this challenge was to display what we learned in our `CSS` section - particularly in the use of [flexbox](#flexbox), [media queries](#media-queries), and [variables](#variables). 
## Flexbox
Building the elements of a page within a `flexbox` allows for us to place them where we want in relation to each other and to allow them to adapt better through varying viewports. 
My `header`, `footer`, `About`, and `Work` sections all had children contained within  a `flexbox`. The `header` and `footer` had `a elements` which were subdivided into another `flexbox` within its parent. 
## Media Queries
Through the use of `media queries` I could adjust parameters to better accomodate mobile devices. 

## Variables
`CSS Variables` are used to remove repetition and to make the task of adjusting multiple values less tedious. The only place I could incorporate a variable was my `--accent-color` which was used throughout.
Moving forward, I would like to format the page around the use of variables in order to make the overall display and theme more cohesive.
